# Yasa Freelancer — Starter

This is a very simple starter you can deploy quickly.

## How to use
1) Put these files into a folder called `yasa-freelancer` on your Desktop.
2) Double‑click `index.html` to preview locally.
3) Upload to GitHub, then deploy to Vercel to get a public URL.

### Upload to GitHub (commands)
Open Terminal/Command Prompt **inside the `yasa-freelancer` folder** and run:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/yasa-freelancer.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Deploy to Vercel
- Go to https://vercel.com → Login with GitHub → Add New Project → pick `yasa-freelancer` → Deploy.
- Copy the URL (like `https://yasa-freelancer.vercel.app`) and paste it in Pi Developer Portal (Development URL).

> Later, integrate the Pi SDK by adding the official script tag and authentication flow inside `index.html` / `script.js`.
